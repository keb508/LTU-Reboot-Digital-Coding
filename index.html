                <h4>What have I learnt?</h4>
                    <p>I learnt that CSS is used to change the aethetics off a page and it is put into a stylesheet that is referenced in the HTML document. I have also learnt how to add lists and tables to a webpage. </p>

                    <p>I changed the background colour of a webpage using CSS in a stylesheet.</p>
                    <p>I also completed the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/quiztest/quiztest.asp?qtest=HTML" title="W3Schools HTML Quiz" target="_blank">W3Schools HTML Quiz</a> and scored 77%. I am pleased with this score considering I have only just started using HTML. <img src="https://github.com/keb508/LTU-Reboot-Digital-Coding/blob/f5eb8fdf622f7f199bc9a075d82258b5e13ff645/images/HTML%20Quiz%2019th%20Jan%202021.png?raw=true" alt="A screenshot showing my score of 77% for the W3Schools HTML quiz."/>

                <h4>What did I find hard?</h4>
                    <p>Trying to remember all the different tags and new vocabulary seems like a challenge at the moment but I am surprising myself with how much I actually know when I practice coding.</p>

            <h3>HTML & CSS</h3>
                        
                <h4>What have I learnt?</h4>
                    <p>I learnt how to use CSS stylesheets to change how text looks in a webpage. I have also learnt how to use id and class to apply properties to a single element and multiple elements respectively.
                <h4>How did I use this in practice?</h4>
                    <p>I used div tags to section a webpage. I also set up ids and classes in a webpage so I could give them properties from a CSS stylesheet. I can now also use Google fonts in my code.</p>
                <h4>What did I find hard?</h4>
                    <p>I had already seen ids and classes on FreeCodeCamp and had made a reference note for myself about the order of priorites in a cascade.</p>
