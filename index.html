            <h3>Course Introduction</h3>

                <h4>What have I learnt?</h4>
                    <p>I learnt the difference between front end and back end developers and the different languages they use.</p>
                <h4>How did I use this in practice?</h4>
                    <p>I am more interested in learning Javascript so I am going to primarily focus on being a back end developer.</p>
                <h4>What did I find hard?</h4>
                    <p>Nothing was hard but there was a lot of new vocabulary to get used to.</p>

                <h4>What have I learnt?</h4>
                    <p>I learnt about the type of tools web developers use and the standards they need to design to. I also found out where I could go online to help me learn how to use HTML, CSS and Javascript.</p>
                <h4>How did I use this in practice?</h4>
                    <p>I started the HTML course on FreeCodeCamp.</p>
                <h4>What did I find hard?</h4>
                    <p>Nothing was hard, but I now need to explore all the learning resources and decide which are the best for me to use.</p>

                    <p>I have set up a repository for this course and have set up Visual Studio Code and GitHub Desktop to use with my GitHub account.</p>
                <h4>What did I find hard?</h4>
                    <p>Nothing was hard but I now might be able to make something work on GitHub that I had started on another project.</p>

                    <p>I set up a branch in my repositary and have also created this html document to log my CPD.</p>
                <h4>What did I find hard?</h4>
                    <p>The practical aspect of the lesson was not hard but I am becoming more confident using the correct vocabulary and definitions.</p>

                <h4>How did I use this in practice?</h4>
                    <p>I used tags to create headings and weblinks, and also give emphasis to workds in the content.</p>
                <h4>What did I find hard?</h4>
                    <p>Nothing was hard, the majority of the content in the lesson today I had already looked at myself in FreeCodeCamp.</p>

            <h3>HTML & CSS</h3>
                        
                <h4>What have I learnt?</h4>
                    <p>I learnt that CSS is used to change the aethetics off a page and it is put into a stylesheet that is referenced in the HTML document. I have also learnt how to add lists and tables to a webpage. </p>
                <h4>How did I use this in practice?</h4>
                    <p>I changed the background colour of a webpage using CSS in a stylesheet.</p>
                    <p>I also completed the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/quiztest/quiztest.asp?qtest=HTML" title="W3Schools HTML Quiz" target="_blank">W3Schools HTML Quiz</a> and scored 77%. I am pleased with this score considering I have only just started using HTML. <img src="https://github.com/keb508/LTU-Reboot-Digital-Coding/blob/f5eb8fdf622f7f199bc9a075d82258b5e13ff645/images/HTML%20Quiz%2019th%20Jan%202021.png?raw=true" alt="A screenshot showing my score of 77% for the W3Schools HTML quiz."/>
                    </p>
                <h4>What did I find hard?</h4>
                    <p>Trying to remember all the different tags and new vocabulary seems like a challenge at the moment but I am surprising myself with how much I actually know when I practice coding.</p>

            <h3>HTML & CSS</h3>
                        
                <h4>What have I learnt?</h4>
                    <p>I learnt how to use CSS stylesheets to change how text looks in a webpage. I have also learnt how to use id and class to apply properties to a single element and multiple elements respectively.
                        </p>
                <h4>How did I use this in practice?</h4>
                    <p>I used div tags to section a webpage. I also set up ids and classes in a webpage so I could give them properties from a CSS stylesheet. I can now also use Google fonts in my code.</p>
                <h4>What did I find hard?</h4>
                    <p>I had already seen ids and classes on FreeCodeCamp and had made a reference note for myself about the order of priorites in a cascade.</p>

                <h4>What have I learnt?</h4>
                    <p>I learnt how to use pseudoclasses to change the property of a link when it is interacted with in different ways by the user. I also learnt about the box model; the padding, border and margin around content. Finally I learnt about static positioning and how relative and absolute position can be used to take an element out of the normal flow of the page.
                    </p>
                <h4>How did I use this in practice?</h4>
                    <p>I used pseudocode to chnage the properties of links. I also tried using absolute and relative positioning, mainly to try and get an intuitive idea for how they will affect elements.</p>
                <h4>What did I find hard?</h4>
                    <p>The hardest thing was trying to establish my usnderstanding for absolute positioning. I think I need to try a few more examples to make sure I am confident that I know how my code would affect the look of a page.</p>

                <h4>How did I use this in practice?</h4>
                    <p>I can now place this side by side on a webpage.</p>
                    <p>I also retook the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/quiztest/quiztest.asp?qtest=HTML" title="W3Schools HTML Quiz" target="_blank">W3Schools HTML Quiz</a> and scored 95%; this is good progress from when I first took the quiz. <img src="https://github.com/keb508/LTU-Reboot-Digital-Coding/blob/main/images/HTML%20Quiz%2022nd%20Jan%202021.png?raw=true" alt="A screenshot showing my score of 95% for the W3Schools HTML quiz."/>
                    </p>
                    <p>I also completed the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_quiz.asp" title="W3Schools CSS Quiz" target="_blank">W3Schools CSS Quiz</a> and scored 92%. This is the first time I have taken this test and I am happy with the score I achieved. <img src="https://github.com/keb508/LTU-Reboot-Digital-Coding/blob/main/images/CSS%20Quiz%2022nd%20Jan%202021.png?raw=true" alt="A screenshot showing my score of 92% for the W3Schools CSS quiz."/>

                <h4>What did I find hard?</h4>
                    <p>I now have a better understanding of absolute and relative positioning. I am looking forward to starting to code with Javascript.</p>

                <h4>What have I learnt?</h4>
                    <p> I have already started learning the basics of Javascript on FreeCodeCamp last year. I didn't learn anything new this lesson. I used it as a reminder of the basics.
                    </p>
                <h4>How did I use this in practice?</h4>
                    <p>I found the tasks were quite easy so I have started going over the FreeCodeCamp Javascript lessons again to get back up to speed on arrays and objects.</p>
                <h4>What did I find hard?</h4>
                    <p>I didn't find any of it hard, but I am looking forward to probkem solving with Javascript.</p>

                <h4>What have I learnt?</h4>
                    <p> I was reminded how to use functions and if/else statements. </p>            
                <h4>How did I use this in practice?</h4>
                    <p>I wrote functions that included returning variables. I also remembered that I could use switch instead of if/else statements so I will be looking at that tonight so I can try and use it in the next task.</p>
                <h4>What did I find hard?</h4>
                    <p>It isn't hard to get the correct outcome for the tasks, the challenge is making the code as neat and efficient as possible; this is what I am trying to improve on.

                <h4>What have I learnt?</h4>
                    <p> I had seen switch statements before but it was good to try the taskd and see if I had remembered how to use them correctly. </p>            
                <h4>How did I use this in practice?</h4>
                    <p>I enjoyed making the basic calculator and I would like to turn it into a project of my own. I have already researched how to code other mathematical functions.</p>
                <h4>What did I find hard?</h4>
                    <p> I am feeling more confident knowing where to start on a task and how to spot which statements or functions I should use.
